In this multiclass sentiment analysis project, I used pre-trained BERT for it with 2 epochs, and it got to 90& accuracy only on 2nd epochs.

Files Guidance:
1. requirements.txt (package and library version that needed to be use for this project, remember to add streamlit)
2. Twitter_Tweets_BERT.ipynb (Whole coding part of the project is inside of this file, from preprocessing to evaluation)
3. twitter-prediction-check.py (Just to confirm whether running .py from laptop side is working or not while importing model's file)
4. app.py (Host the model on a website with GUI, let others to make prediction on it)
